"""
OK HOLY SHIT IF YOU EVER CREATE A NEGATIVE INDEX YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THAT IS APPLICABLE IN INDEXING
WHERE YOU DON'T EXPECT IT. GOD.

I handled out of bounds indexes using a try|except block on IndexError, however negative indexes will not
raise IndexError as they will then point towards the element enumerated from the end of the iterable. This
is fine for out of pounds positive integers, but not negative integers.

Also, just use numpy
